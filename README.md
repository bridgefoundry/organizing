## Organizing: Where organizers make workshops happen. :boom:

Planning RailsBridge workshops should be visibile and transparent; that makes it easier to know where we need help and helps everyone understand (and hopefully improve) how we organize. To jump in, checkout the [list](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/issues) of the workshops currently being planned. 

When organizing, remember the mission of RailsBridge is to diversify and improve the software developemnt community. We ask that:
1. Your workshop be targeted to a group of people that are underrepresented in the community. That might be women, people of color, non-native English speakers, LGBQA communities, or other marginalized groups.
2. Your workshop is free for students to attend.

## Helping Out
This repo is the place to propose a workshop, volunteer to organize, or sponsor a workshop by offering space or :moneybag:. If you want to teach at or attend a workshop, head over to [BridgeTroll](http://www.bridgetroll.org/) to RSVP for a workshop near you! If you want to make improvements to the RailsBridge curricula, you want [railsbridge/docs](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs).

#### Kick off a Workshop
If you want to kick off a workshop, start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/issues/new). Create one issue for each workshop when you start organizing. It's awesome if the issue title includes a date, and location, as far as you know. (And you can always edit the issue.) 

CC your collaborators, make [todo lists](https://github.com/blog/1542-task-lists-in-gist) for everything that needs to be done, and add all the appropriate labels. (It's okay if you don't have Check out the [first one](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/issues/1) as an example, and feel free to copy [this gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rachelmyers/55f5d2720ec957a499bb/raw/1c31bac5bb56f7da29a05ed52c8863d99479b2a6/issue_template.md) as a template when creating a new issue. :bowtie:

Then have a conversation to hammer out the details of the workshop in the comments section. (Make sure to not say confidential things -- like people's phone numbers. The whole point of this is that **everyone can see** how we're organizing workshops.) 

Optionally, you can also ask anyone on the @railsbridge/organizers team to add you to the team. (That will let you add and remove labels on the issue, plus it's a cool group of people to be on a team with.) 

**If you're on the @railsbridge/organizers team, you only need the username and [this link](https://github.com/orgs/railsbridge/teams/organizers) to add someone to the team. It's that easy!** :palm_tree:

#### Volunteer to Organize a Workshop
If you'd like to organize a workshop, you can filter the workshops being planned by [ones that need organizers](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/labels/Needs%20Organizer). If there's a workshop in your area, chime in and offer to help out!

There are also sometimes workshops that have organizers, but the organizers would love help. Feel free to browse through [all the issues](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/issues). If you see something hanging, leave a comment letting the organizers know you're available to pitch in. (Also, browsing the issues is a great way to get a feel for what goes into a workshop.)

:racehorse:

If you're an SF metaorganizer, [this private list of organizers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al9a5yeo4q0AdEtJVDlrb3dXckd4bFktUGptM2VkWmc#gid=1) may be useful to you.

#### Volunteer to Sponsor a workshop

Most RailsBridge workshops are held in the offices of companies that support what we're doing. If you'd like to volunteer your space, you can filter the open workshops by [ones that need a venue](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/labels/Needs%20Venue/Sponsor)! If you find a workshop you want to host, chime in with a note on the issue, and let the organizers know the location, the capacity of your office, and anything else you think will be relevant for organizers. 

For example, a great message would be:
> Hi, I work at Sprokets Incoporated, and we would love to host this workshop! We're located at 123 22nd Street. The open area where we could have lunch holds about 50 people, and we have 8 mid-size conference rooms to hold about 40 people. (Each conference room has a way to project the teacher's screen PLUS whiteboards!) People usually have to sign in with security when they come to the building, but I talked with our facilities manager, and everyone on your RSVP list will be on the security fast track! (I also talked our our recuiting team and engineering manager, and we'll also be able to sponsor the event, up to $1,000!) Let me know if it's a deal; I'm super excited to make this happen! 

If your company doesn't have space to host a workshop but want to contribute as a company, you can filter the workshops by those that [need a venue and sponsor](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/labels/Needs%20Venue/Sponsor) or those only [need a sponsor](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/labels/Needs%20Sponsor), and chime in to offer support, with a message like this:

> Hi, I work at Sprokets Incoporated, and we would love to sponsor this workshop, up to $1,500!) Two of our engineers are waiting to RSVP as teachers, and our Lead Recruiter asked to also volunteer, maybe with helping people sign in. He just wants to be there for the 3 minute spiel at the beginning, and to answer anyone's questions about Sprokets. Our whole company is really excited to support the work RailsBridge is doing.

If you don'y find a workshop to support, don't dispair! Email hello@railsbridge.org and someone will help you out! :wink:

## GitHub ProTipsâ„¢

#### Emoji
All these cool pictures (like :neckbeard, :nail_care:, :rat:, and :space_invader: ) are from a font called [Emoji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji). To insert emoji into your comments on GitHub, type the name of the emoji, surrounded by colons, like this `:dolphin:`. Check out the [Emoji Cheat Sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for the names of all the Emoji!

#### Email and Notifications
If you've turned off your GitHub notifications, you won't be notified when people mention you or respond to you on issues. If you hate getting email, you can always check your [notifications](https://github.com/notifications) page. Check your notification settings [here](https://github.com/settings/notifications).

The notifications you get via your email may look similar to the emails from the organizers mailing list. The difference, of course, is that your response will become a comment on the public issues. Just something to be aware of. :wink:
